# perlProj
A web application use JQuery, JSon and Perl

The front end of this application is developed with Jquery, JS. The backend use Perl accessing the sqlite database.

I suggest to use xampp to test this application,the path for the perl.exe is under

#!C:\xampp\perl\bin\perl.exe

In case you are using differnt system, please change this line in the addApplointment.pl and getAppointment.pl.

After install, please use the http://localhost/appointment/cgi/initDB.pl to create the db or clear the db.
